# Log-DiscrAnalysis

Logistic regression is used to predict a categorical (usually dichotomous) variable from a set of predictor variables. - For a logistic regression, the predicted dependent variable is a function of the probability that a particular subject will be in one of the categories.

Discriminant analysis performs a multivariate test of differences between groups.iscriminant analysis is used to determine the minimum number of dimensions needed to describe these differences. A distinction is sometimes made between descriptive discriminant analysis and predictive discriminant analysis.
